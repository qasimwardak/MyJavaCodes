Super keyword:
Super is keyword in java that we can use to access immediate parent class members
like fields, methods and constructors.
Method overloading:
1) is a way of utilizing methods with different parameters but same name
2) allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,
if their arguments are different.
in java we can distinguish between different methods by method signature
method signature is a combination of method name type of parameters that we are
passing as an argument and the sequence of the parameters.

we can create methods with same name if we the parameters to our methods have the
below properties
1) method should have different number of parameters

print(){}
print(String name){}
print(String name,String address){
}

print(String name,String address,String phoneNumbers){
}
2)
we can overload methods we we provide different types of parameters.
print(){}
print(String name){}
print(int num1){
}

print(double num1){
}
3)
we can also overload oue methods if we change the sequence of the parameters
print(String name,int num,char c){}
print(char c,String name,int num){}
print(int num,char c,String name){}

print(double num1){
}

Note:
By changing the return type or the access modifiers we can not overload
methods in java
