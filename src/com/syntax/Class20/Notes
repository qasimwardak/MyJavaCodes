1. If we have some properties or methods in a class we can utilize these members in another class
2.without rewriting them again.


This keyword with constructors is used to call other constructors inside
our constructors it can help reduce the amount of code
if we have 100 lines of code we do not need this code in each constructor
we can just put that code in a single constructor and we can call that
constructor from other constructors

Class ConsDemo{

field 1
field 2
field 3
field 4

ConsDemo(){
100 important lines of code
}

ConsDemo(field 1){
this()
}

ConsDemo(field 1,field 2){
this()
}
ConsDemo(field 1,field 2,field 3){
this()
}




}
