Abstraction:
is a process of showing the functionality
to the user and hiding the implementation details.
we can achieve the abstraction in java in two ways
1) Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces
Abstract classes can have abstract methods we can implement those abstract methods in
our child classes.
Rules to follow:
We can have as many abstract methods as we want in a class.
1) To declare an abstract we can use abstract keyword.
2)we can't have abstract methods as private because they will never be
inherited and we will not able to provide implementation for those
2) same way we can't declare our methods as final because final methods can never be overridden
abstract class ParentClass{

public abstract method1();
}
Interfaces
always have fields as public static and final. which means we cannot change them we can
only access them.
