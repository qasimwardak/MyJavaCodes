Why we need files
1) We can store the data permanently on our computers
2) It helps us separating the sensitive info from the code
3) Every time we have to make a change in the data we don't
need to recompile and redeploy our code

FileHandling in Java
File is a way of storing the data permanent on our hard drives.
Files and programs are separate entities we can use below classes to connect
the files with our java Program. We can have different files on our computer
like excel, word, Text etc. To manipulate these files we have separate classes inside java
as each file has its own structure.
We use below files to manipulate property files.
FileInputStream:
This class creates a connection between our code and the file.
To manipulate Property files we have a special class in java called Properties.
