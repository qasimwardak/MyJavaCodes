Files help us separate our data from our code so that everytime if we have to change
the data we don't change our code. We don't want to change our code with our data

deploying the code on different servers starts over

what is an Exception in Java.
Exception is an unwanted behaviour that can cause our programs to terminate abruptly.
How we should handle these unwanted behaviours  we should use try and catch block to handle
these issues
why prefer try catch over If else condition

2) It will give us the complete information about the error
3) these exception provide us standard error messages which are same across the industry
