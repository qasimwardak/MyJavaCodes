String is a built-in class in Java that can be used to manipulate all of the
characters that present on the keyboard

String are immutable everytime we declare a variable of type string
all of the memory cells in the StringPool Area will searched and if a memory cell
with same content is available the location of that cell will be assigned to our
local variable  and no new cell will be created in the memory this can be very useful
if we have to store same data again and again in the memory.we can save space!

if we are declaring a box of type StringBuilder no memory location will be searched
and a new box of type StringBuilder will be created in the heap and the address of that
box will be stored in our local variable everytime if we have to store different different
data in the memory we should be using String Builder class

Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer
StringBuilder is not thread safe and we can use it if we are not using multithreading
in our java code because there will no conflicts but if we have
written multithreaded code we should always use StringBuffer class why because it is thread safe
and there will be no conflicts

why we get NUllPointerException?
Everytime we we try to call a method on a null our java can not find the
specified method from
the heap and we get this exception
