Final keyword:
final is keyword in java that can be used with class field and methods.
if we have declared a class as final class then no other class can inherit our
class.

final public class DemoClass{

int number;
democlass(int number){
this.number=number
}
void printNumber(){
sout number
}
}

public class ChildClass extends DemoClass{ CE //cannot inherit from a final class

}

Benefits of final classes:
1) Privacy
2) A<-B<-C<-D..... if we have a very long chain of classes which have a inheritance
relations and if we want to restrict this chain we can use the final keyword why
because we may waste a lot of memory if we don not use these classes properly
