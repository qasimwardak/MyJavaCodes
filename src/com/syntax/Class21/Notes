Inheritance:
Inheritance is mechanism in java through which we can use the fields and methods
from one class to other class without re-writing a single line of
code /repeating the code
from the class from which we are inheriting.
Benefits of using inheritance:
1) Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution.
2) It helps use reduce duplicate code
3) saves time
4) reusing the same code again.
Disadvantages:
classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class
Class Parent{
int Money;
void print(){
sout"Money ="+Money
}
}

class Child extends Parent{

main(){
Child child=new Child()
child.print();

}
}

we can access our static fields and methods using class names and using objects
of the class bu using Class name is preferable because static methods and fields
belong to class not to objects.
SuperKeyword:
As we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can use super
keyword to access the fields and methods from immediate parent class.
it is used in subclasses to access superclass members
in inheritance when we create an object
of a class all of the default constructors from p
