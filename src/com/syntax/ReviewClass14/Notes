Collections Framework
Its a set of classes and interfaces that help us store and manipulate
data efficiently in computer's main memory.
Why we should use collections frame instead of arrays and variables.
variables can only store one value at a time
Arrays are static data structures that can not change their size at runtime. Once we have declared
an array we can not change its size. We do not have any built
in methods on arrays to manipulate the data
Collection framework
1) Dynamic in nature can grow and shrink their size at runtime
2) We have built in methods to manipulate the data

Collections framework an custom classes
if we are creating our own class and we want to utilize the full benefits of the collection
frame we must override the equals hashcode and toString methods from Object class and we should
implement the comparable interface

Maps:
they are separate from the collections framework they provide meaningful indexes and we
can search the elements very quickly
