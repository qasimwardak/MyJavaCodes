we are thinking of going shopping:

first we check is store has sale:
	if no sale --> no shopping
	if sale --> we go for shopping
			ask for the price:

			if price from 10 to 50 --> we give 10% discount
			if price is between 50 -100 --> 20 % discount
			if price is between 100 -500 --> 40 % discount
			if price is more than 500 --> 50 % discount

			Your program should calculate final prcie that you will after discount!
