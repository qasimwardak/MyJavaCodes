Interfaces
Itâ€™s a mechanism to archive abstraction in java. we can achieve 100%
Abstraction and multiple inheritance using the interfaces.
we use interface when we know nothing about implementation and we only know
about the  functionality
1) An interface have all of the fields as public static final by default
and we can not create instance fields why because we can not create an object
of Interface. If we try to declare the fields as anything other than public static final we
will get an error. They are widely used to support lambdas in java
2) An interface can have static methods, default method and abstract methods
3) Any class who implements the Interface has to provide the implementation for the
abstract methods or we can declare that class as abstract.
