Class:
classes are blueprints/templates/States behaviours/block of code/ that
helps us model a real life object like car/bike/computer/
For Example:
we can have a Car class which can have properties and behaviours
that can be used to build a specific model of card like Toyota/Maza etc
class NameOfClass{
String model;
String make;
String color;
int year;

void drive(){
sout""
}

void switchgear(){
}

void applyBreaks(){

}

void drift(){
}
}

In a class We can have fields/methods/Constructors/initializer blocks
what is the difference between a class and object;

class is a blueprint,
obj is an instance of a class
