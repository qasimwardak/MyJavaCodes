Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables in java.
1) Local
2) Instance
3) Static
Local:
Local variables are created in the methods,constructor or block of code.
They are declared when we enter a block of code and are destroyed as soon as we
left the block of code.
Block of code:
While loops
for loops
if conditions
switch
Important points
1) We can not use the access modifiers with local variables.
2) local variables are not initialized with default values they must be initialized
before we can access them.
When to use local variables.
we should always try to use local variables because they are destroyed as soon as
execution left the block of code that way we can utilize this memory for other
purposes.

Instance variables.
are created inside the class but outside the method, block of code or constructor.
They are called instance variables because they belong to the instance of class
and they can have different values for all of the objects of that class
Note:
whenever we need to access something in multiple methods or constructor we should use instance
variables but we should always write our logic in such a way to avoid instance variables
because they stay in the memory as long as we have a reference to our object.
Important:
1)We can use the access modifiers with the instance variables i.e Private, Default,Protected,Public
2)Instance variables have default values for boolean=false for double=0.0 for int=0 and for String=null
Whenever we create an object of a class a separate memory location for instance
variables is declared and we can store different different things in those location.
of the objects

Static:
Static variables are class variables they are declared outside of method,
constructor or block of code. we use static keyword to before specifying
the type of variables.
For static variables only one memory location is declared in the static area for all
of the objects same memory location is used. These values are same for all objects.
When to use?
when we have something common for all objects
when all the objects of the same class share a common info

Important
1)static variables are rarely used other than being declared
as final
2)static variables are stored in the static memory area
3)Visibility is same as instance variables
4)static fields and methods can be access by just specifying
the name of the class and name of variable or method
5) In static variables we define common values.
==============================================================
Java modifiers
1) Access modifiers like private, default, protected and public
2) Non-access modifiers like final,abstract,static,synchronized
Access modifiers: these can be used to control the visibility of our instance/static variables/methods/
