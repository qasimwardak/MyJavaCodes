File handling in java:
what are files.
Files are mechanism that help us store data permanently on our commuter
why we should use file instead of putting the data with code.
Every time when we need to make a change,
we don't need to redeploy and recompile the code
Steps involved in the compiling and deploying the code.
servers=> Computers that are up all the time they are same as our normal laptop/computers but with
very good hardware.
1) Developers develop code on development serves performs unit testing deploy
this code to QA servers.
2) Testers Test the applications on the QA server
3) After QA is done they may deploy the code on Performance, security testing servers
4) Deployment on Staging servers
5) Deployment on UAT servers
6) Deployment on Production servers
To avoid all of these processes we create a configuration file and we store the configuration in that
file
this configuration file may contain.
