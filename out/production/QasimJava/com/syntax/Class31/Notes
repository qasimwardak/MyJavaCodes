3 ways to store the data using java.
1) variables(we can store only one value)
2) Arrays( They can store multiple objects but they are fixed in size)
3) Collection( Can store multiple objects and they are dynamic can grow and shrink the size at runtime)
we can not use primitives with collections. Collections can be used with objects only.
Wrapper Classes:
Mechanism that allows primitive types to be used as a objects / non primitives
Are classes from java guys that help us use collections with our primitive types as they are objects
they also have many built-in methods to manipulate the data types for example converting a string to an Integer
String number="10"
int num=Integer.parseInt(number)
Iterator is an interface that lets use iterate through any collection. It has three methods
hasNext() --checks if there are any elements left in the collection
next()  -- will return me the next element from the collection
remove().  -- remove method it will remove the element from the collection.
All of the collection classes they have a method iterator() using this method i can get an object
of the iterator and then i can call the above three methods to iterate or to remove the elements
Note:
Iterators can be used only once. Once we have used the iterator we need a new once
if we want to iterate the collection again.
ArrayList:
Are consecutive memory locations
