Yet another type of variables
1) Local
2) instance variables
3)static variables
local variables:
any variable that is declared inside a method or a block like while
loop for loop if condition or inside the constructor are called
local variables.
properties of local variables.
1)we can't access them out side of the block
for example
if(2>1){
int x=10 //this variable will not be accessible outside of the
//curly brackets of if condition
}
x=20 CE
2) As soon as we are done with method these local variables are destroyed and memory(RAM)
is freed and is available to be used by other programs which means they are very efficient in
managing the memory and that's why they are always recommended over instance variables.

instance variables:
All of the variables which are declared outside of the methods or
blocks or constructors but inside a class are called instance variables.
properties:
1)Memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created and it says
in the memory unless we are done with the closing bracket.
2) they are highly discouraged because they are not efficient in handling memory(RAM).

Static variables:
They are declared outside of the methods, constructor and block of codes with static keyword

Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are just keywords(Private public protected) that help use reduce the visibility of our variables and methods
so that no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data.
private:
If we use Private access modifier with our variable or method we can only access that variable from the same class
we use it to protect critical information that we do not want to expose.
class Account{
private int balance;

void depositMoney(){
if(boolean properChannel,int money){

balance=balance+money
}
}
}

class hacker{
balance=100000;//CE Cannot access

}

Default:
This is not a keyword it a behaviour which is assigned to the methods or properties automatically if we are not assigning
any access modifier.
package1
class{
String car;

}

package2
class family{
car="i am your little brother i am using your car today forgive i destroy it"
}

if we do not specify any modifiers default behaviour will assigned to our variables
and methods and they will only be available within the same package.
public:
if we declare our methods or instance variables we can access
them from anywhere any package any class.

package1
class{
public String car;

}

package2
class family{
car="i am your just a random guy i am using your car today forgive i destroy it"
}
