FileHandling in Java:
Reading and writing the data to files is called file handling we have two main classes
FileInputStream and FileOutputStream that we use to handle files.
whenever we have to read the data from the file we use FileInputStream and
whenever we have to write the data we use FileOutputStream.
Properties file:
Properties files contains the configuration data in the form of key and value pairs.
Exceptions:
This is a mechanism in java to handle errors
why we should be using the exceptions because they gives us a lot of standard information
about our errors like line number the method name the class name complete stacktrace.
