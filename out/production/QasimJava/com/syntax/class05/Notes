I need to define whether nu,ber that is entered from user is small, large and extra large

if number is > 1 but smalled than 10 --> small
if number is >11 but smaller than 100 --> number is big

AND (&&)

if ( true && true) --> TRUE
if ( true && false) --> FALSE
if (false && true) --> FALSE
if (false && false) --> FALSE

OR (||)

if (true || true) --> TRUE
if (true || false) --> TRUE
if (false || true) --> TRUE
if (false || false) --> FALSE

You are working in sales and have to calculate commission for the employees;

You need to ask user a sales amount and based on the amout you need to define their commission

if user sold products for more than $10 but less than 100 --> commision is 10%

if sales is more than 100 but less then 200 --> commision is 20%

if sales is more than 200 but less then 500 --> commision is 30%

if sales is more than 500 --> commision is 50%

You program should print How much money in comission user will get
