may or may not return some data
collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation
Example:

return num1+num2;
}
Benefits:
1) increases readability
2) easy modification
3) save memory
4) Better organization
When should we use the methods in our code:
if more than 3 lines of code are being repeated create a method for them.

How methods work:
when ever methods are called all the statements inside those methods are executed.

Calling a method.
we can call non static methods by using the objects only
Important points
We can call the static methods and can use static fields from non static methods without objects or class name
if we are in the same class, but we can not call non static methods from static methods
