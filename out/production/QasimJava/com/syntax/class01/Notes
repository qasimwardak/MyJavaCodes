Keywords - are reserved words in Java (public, class, void, pachage, break, final....)

Identifiers - simply a name that we will be giving to our classes, variables and method.

Rules for identifiers:

1. We cannot use keywords as identifiers
2. Identifier should not start with number, but it can have numbers as second, 3 or last character
3. Identifier cannot start with special characters, EXCEPT
	($, _)

Naming Conventions

1. we should follow camel casing
2. when we create classes they usually will start with UpperCase and follow camelcasing
3. when we create variables they usually should start with lowercase and follow camelcasing
