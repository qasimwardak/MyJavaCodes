Recap:
Access modifiers
private
protected ,default
public
Access modifiers are used to the control the access to our class members
like fields and method
private access modifier which is the most restricted it allows to access our
class members like method and instance variables/fields/properties from
the same class only
compiler it converts your java code to the byte code which our JVM can understand
JVM it takes byte and converts that code to machine that our computers can understands

for example
class PrivateClass{

private int salary

private transferSalaryToEmpBankACC(){
//some code

}

}


protected/Default
Default is not a keyword it is just a behaviour which is assigned to our
properties or methods if we do not specify any access modifier.
And these field/properties/attributes or methods/behaviours are then only
accessible with the same package.
public:
public is a keyword in java and it controls the access to our fields and methods
if we use this access modifier all of the our methods and fields can be accessed
from anywhere inside our code base
